<h2>FAQ</h2>

<a name="qa_general"></a>
<h3>Overall</h3>
	<h4>Is the calculated result really right?</h4>
	<p>We've probably been able to fit to the internal process because of Nen-nen, who provided data to me. (Thank him!) However, since we calculate with HP percentage, there're cases where we can't put a strict result out.</p>
	<h4>I've ever heard catch probability can't be calculated without the number of max HP and the number of remaining HP...</h4>
	<p>As a matter of fact, we discovered both the max HP and the remaining HP aren't needed for the calculation. So I've made this program using it this time.</p>
	<p>To know details, please see the Term Explanation.</p>
	<h4>Do you properly support the balls which works on a condition, such as Heavy Ball, Net Ball, and Love Ball?</h4>
	<p>Yes. We support those as much as possible, and calculate using actual Pok&eacute;mon's data (weight, type, and so on) earnestly.</p>
	<h4>That's an impossible combination!</h4>
	<p>Uh, that's right. If you hook a Venusaur, goldfish game's master must get a pallid face. If there're Groudons in various parts of the world, they must cause much more than natural disaster. If there's Mewtwo in Safari Zone, everybody runs away.</p>
	<p>But, those are good things which gives you and us a dream, aren't those? Now you've been in agreement. It's specifications, not a bug.</p>
	<p>Such as we are, we're making effort to deal with those as much as possible, though.</p>
	<h4>I say, I hit an error after I directly entered a Pok&eacute;mon name.</h4>
	<p>It won't work if "That Pok&eacute;mon won't be found" has come out below. The right name may come out by deleting letters.</p>
	<h4>How do you calculate it?</h4>
	<p>It's described by the section "É{Å[Éã(ball)" of each the ÇPçÜäŸ(1st building) and the ÇQçÜäŸ(2nd building) on <a href="http://www.pic.bz/">É|ÉPÉbÉgÉÇÉìÉXÉ^Å[èÓïÒÉZÉìÉ^Å[</a>(Pokemon Information Center)</p>
	<p>In the case of Diamond/Pearl, also see the article <a href="http://wiki.xn--rckteqa2e.com/wiki/ïﬂälèàóù">ïﬂälèàóù</a> (catch process) on <a href="http://wiki.xn--rckteqa2e.com/">É|ÉPÉÇÉìWiki</a>(Pok&eacute;mon Wiki).</p>
	<p>The above are Japanese pages. In English, see the article <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Catch_Rate">Catch rate</a> on <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/">Burubapedia</a></p>
	<h4>What's the "EX-4G"...? lol</h4>
	<p>It's a short for "EXpert enhanced with the 4th Generation and Graph"!</p>
	<p>The 4th generation means Diamond, Pearl, and so on, and the reason for expert is that we're supporting all versions. We've also contained the meaning for graph into 'G'. In this part of the title we intentionally have a plan to follow the (Japanese) teens' liking.</p>
	<h4>Isn't this kinda wrong? Or, I'd like to ask to you!</h4>
	<p>When you are in trouble, have some questions, or hope to make a request, please tell us with <a href="mailto:midis_cube@yahoo.co.jp">mail</a></p>

<h3>Around graph</h3>
	<h4>It would be easy to look if you could display the catch probability at the points of the graph...</h4>
	<p>We've tried to do that at first, but we found that we can't put any characters on the graph due to a restriction of the server. That's why it keeps that.</p>
	<h4>I can't draw a graph with the f**king Safari Ball!</h4>
	<p>Calm down a little. As you know, you can't decrease a Pok&eacute;mon's HP in that Safari Zone which is not allowed battles. The HP is always 100%, so we don't need to draw a graph.</p>

<h3>Gen. IV: Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver</h3>
	<h4>Don't you try this?</h4>
	<p>I've finally got done! Yay.</p>
	<p>Good job, Pok&eacute;mon Wiki editors! I found it already has been clear in 2007. I didn't notice it though I'd seen many times.</p>
	<h4>The result isn't much changed from Ruby/Sapphire, is it?</h4>
	<p>Because the formula hasn't been changed. Sorry!</p>
	<p>But, also this version is independent. Because balls have been increased, and casually the wild in a condition of sleep or ice has become easy to catch.</p>
	<h4>Balls of Apricorn sort were not found, but what was going on?</h4>
	<p>Ah-oh...(;ÅLÑtÅM) In fact I didn't know these because I've never played HG/SS. Feel sorry. For I couldn't possibly take time to play.</p>
	<h4>And yet, Speed Ball can't be used, huh?</h4>
	<p>Because the condition that the effect of Speed Ball works isn't clear yet. It doesn't mean I'm absent.<br>
	They say that is relating to the base stats in Speed of the wild Pok&eacute;mon.</p>
	<h4>Why doesn't the effect of Lure Ball appear?</h4>
	<p>However you put a check to "Hooked by a rod," the effect doesn't appear if the Pok&eacute;mon has not the water type.</p>
	<h4>What's the "0x" so-and-so?</h4>
	<p>It expresses the following value of it is a hexadecimal number. For instance, "0xA4" means "A4 as a hexadecimal number."<br>
	To express an number using 10 characters from 0 to 9 is called the decimal notation, and to express a number using 16 characters from 0 to 9 and from A to F is called the hexadecimal notation. Anyway, it's okay for now even if you have no idea.</p>

<h3>Gen. III: Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen</h3>
	<h4>I can't get the effect of Dive Ball, can I?</h4>
	<p>However you put a check to "In the bottom of the sea," the effect don't appear if the Pok&eacute;mon has not the water type.</p>
	<h4>What's the "0x" so-and-so?</h4>
	<p>It expresses the following value of it is a hexadecimal number. For instance, "0xA4" means "A4 as a hexadecimal number."<br>
	To express an number using 10 characters from 0 to 9 is called the decimal notation, and to express a number using 16 characters from 0 to 9 and from A to F is called the hexadecimal notation. Anyway, it's okay for now even if you have no idea.</p>
	<a name="rs_truth1"></a>
	<h4>I got a feeling that the result which is calculated following the formula of "Pokemon Information Center" and the result which is calculated here are different. (by black_k_123)</h4>
	<p>Portable game machines can cut calculation short. To be concrete, they always calculate omitting fractions. That's the world of 5 / 2 = 2. Also the program of catch decision in the internal of Pok&eacute;mon calculates following it.<br>
	The formulas written in "Pokemon Information Center" intentionally omit the expression in written because of considering that to be natural. If you calculate caring it, you'll get the same result as our calculator. However, there's a point that you might overlook in a timing of omitting fractions. See the next article too.</p>
	<a name="rs_truth2"></a>
	<h4>I've seen the different result that was calculated with a other program of calculating a catch probability.</h4>
	<p>They are properly omitting fractions, but I've ever seen that some fails to do it at the below place.</p>
	<p>B = 000FFFF0 / ( Å„( Å„( 00FF0000/A ) ) )<br>
	<font size="-1" color="gray">* From Pokemon Information Center</font></p>
	<p>In the part of taking a root twice, some of them omitted fractions after doing it twice at once. This is an error. Nen-nen said because the routine for calculating a root returns an integer, they should omit fractions for every taking a root. Therefore, each of the answers comes different in the end.</p>

<h3>Gen. II: Gold, Silver, Crystal</h3>
	<h4>The Lure Ball effect doesn't come out. Why? </h4>
	<p>However you put a check to "Hooked by a rod," the effect doesn't appear if the Pok&eacute;mon has not the water type.</p>
	<h4>The Love Ball's effect can't be seen.</h4>
	<p>Love Ball doesn't take effect to both an genderless Pok&eacute;mon and a single-gender Pok&eacute;mon.</p>
	<p class="goTop"><a href="#top">Back to the menu</a></p>

<a name="qa_rgb"></a>
<h3>Gen. I: Red, Green, Yellow</h3>
	<h4>Hey, great Ball occasionally take a higher catch probability than Ultra Ball...?</h4>
	<p>Well... We wonder why. Seems that phenomenon is brought especially in cases where the remaining HP is more than 50% and there's no status ailment.</p>
	<h4>There're few types of Pok&eacute; Ball.</h4>
	<p>I think so, too. It was really simple in former times, you know. I have been absorbed in my sense of nostalgia while making this, yeah...</p>
	<h4>Safari Ball isn't too.</h4>
	<p>OMG! Don't say that! XD</p>

<h3>Something extra</h3>
	<h4>This FAQ might be...</h4>
	<p>A story written by ourselves. ^_^;; But it hasn't been all. Please ask us your questions.</p>
	<h4>Hidden features on the Pok&eacute;mon input field!</h4>
	<p>You input "_" in the head, then it searches Pok&eacute;mon containing the input in the tail.<br>
	<font color="gray">For example, "_ine": Arcanine, Mantine, and so on.</font></p>
	<p>You input "-" after a Pok&eacute;mon number, then it displays 10 spacies from the number.<br>
	<font color="gray">For exmaple, "480-": from 480.Uxie to 489.Phione</font></p>
	<p>Is that it? Sorta useless.</p>
	<p>By the way, we named this one, which searches a Pok&eacute;mon name without asking, "TyPokeHelper," the Pok&eacute;mon realtime searching feature!</p>
	<p>It's consisted of type, poke, and helper. Thank you... however you would think who cares.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Remaining HP % (Rem. HP %)</dt>
	<dd><p>A ratio of the remaining HP quantity out of the max HP. A percentage, which is the remaining HP devided by the max HP.</p>
	<p>To draw an exact line, here we call the HP, which is expressed by a number as usual, "HP quantity" or "HP qty," and call the HP, which is expressed by a ratio, "HP percentage" or "HP %."</p>
	<p>Though the max HP qty is contained in the formula for finding the catch probability, it doesn't depend on its size actually. Therefore, the catch probability can be calculated if we get this "remaining HP %." This is true through the entire series, and we've proved each not to need those. See the term explanation of each version.</p>
	<p>However, we don't use the formula combined on demonstration in this program, to fit the internal process of the game.</p></dd>
	<dt>Catch rate</dt>
	<dd><p>The degree of easiness to catch. The higher the value, the easier to catch. It's defined in each species.</p></dd>
	<dt>Cumulative catch probability (Cumulative catch prob.)</dt>
	<dd><p>Against the catch probability, which means the probability of catch on throwing a ball once, it means the probability of catch from the result on thrown a ball many times. You can get it from:</p>
	<p>p<sub>c</sub> = 1 - p<sup>b</sup></p>
	<p>which p<sub>c</sub> is the cumulative catch probability, p is the catch probability, and b is the number of balls used.</p>
	<p>This is an approach that the more the throws the better the probability of catch.</p>

	<p>The low limit value is given from the max HP qty devided by the low limit constant which is the following:</p>
	<blockquote>Pok&eacute; Ball = 3<br>
	Great Ball = 2<br>

<h3>Proof that the catch probability has no relation to the quantity of Pok&eacute;mon's max HP</h3>
